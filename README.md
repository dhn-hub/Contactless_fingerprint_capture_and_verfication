# Contactless_fingerprint_capture_and_verfication

Contactless fingerprint scanners, provide a decrease in energy use, an improved user experience, and, most crucially, a considerably reduced danger of infection and cross-contamination due to the use of contactless scanning.
In this modern era, verifications and biometrics are performed via contactless devices. This project uses a camera that captures a person's fingerprint, checks it against a stored database performs the algorithm and grants access if there is a match.
Tools used: Opencv, Qtcreator, C++
The workflow of this project is shown in the form of flow chart below:
